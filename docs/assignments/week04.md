# 4. Group Assignment - Computer controlled cutting

This week I worked on defining my final project idea and started to getting used to the documentation process.

## **Cardboard (Sarah Nadir)**

I was assigned to cut carboard and test the settings.

I chose `Natural` > `Paper` > `Cardboard 3mm`. However, upon measuring the cardboard, I found that it was around 3.6mm, so I changed the `material thickness` setting accordingly. I did a few trials with different powers, speed, and frequency, and all those trials are documented below.

| Power | Speed | Frequency |                                                                                       |
|-------|-------|-----------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 65%   | 27%   | 500       | Did not cut, rather formed sort of an engraving.                                      |
| 100%  | 20%   | 500       | Managed to cut, but did not achieve the drop-down test.                               |
| 100%  | 24%   | 500       | Managed to penetrate through all the layers, yet it was still stuck to the cardboard. |
| 100%  | 15%   | 500       | My favorite settings! It was a star at the drop-down test.                            |

>When the pieces cut fall out of the material without having to push them out, thats what I call a drop-down.

## **Cast Acrylic (Sara Alhadhrami)**

I tested the Transparent Cast Acrylic with a thickness of 2.7mm

I used a simple design to find out the best power and speed needed to be set in the
Laser Cutting Machine **(Universal Laser Systems Machine)** for cutting and engraving the 2.7mm Cast Acrylic.
In addition to measure and calculate the amount of the material that was burned during the cut, which called (Kerf).

First I cut using the default settings, then I did three trials to see the effect of changing speed and power of the laser machine on the material.

### **Default Settings**

| Type      |  Power  |  Speed  | PPL                                                                                |
|-----------|---------|---------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Cut       | 100%    | 4.4%    | 1000                                                                               |
| Engraving | 26%     | 100%    | 500                                                                                |

### **First Trial**

In the first trial I reduced the Power to 80% for the cut and I increased it to 35% for engraving.
I liked the result of engraving but the cut caused more of the gray surface at the edges.

| Type      |  Power  |  Speed  | PPL                                                                                |
|-----------|---------|---------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Cut       | 80%     | 4.4%    | 1000                                                                               |
| Engraving | 35%     | 100%    | 500                                                                                |

### **Second Trial**

In the second trial I increased the speed of cutting to 10% and reduced the speed of engraving to 80%.
Engraving was good and it looks more white but the cut wasn't perfect, it was a little bit hard so separate it from the plate.

| Type      |  Power  |  Speed  | PPL                                                                                |
|-----------|---------|---------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Cut       | 100%    | 10%     | 1000                                                                               |
| Engraving | 26%     | 80%     | 500                                                                                |

### **Third Trial**

In the third trial, I increased the speed of cutting to 25% and decreased the speed of engraving to 50%. The result of engraving still nice but the speed of cutting was fast and didn't cut the material.

| Type      |  Power  |  Speed  | PPL                                                                                |
|-----------|---------|---------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Cut       | 100%    | 25%     | 1000                                                                               |
| Engraving | 26%     | 50%     | 500                                                                                |

### **Calculating Kerf (Cast Acrylic)**

Then I started designing a 60x30 mm rectangle to calculate the [kerf](https://www.instructables.com/How-to-Adjust-for-Wood-Thickness-and-Kerf-on-a-Las/). I divided into 12 equal rectangles with 5 mm width each. I did this step in Fusion360 by using the rectangular pattern tool.

![](../images/controlledcutting/SaraAli_kerf1.jpg)

I saved the design as DXF file and I open it in **CorelDraw** software to cut it.

After cut

![](../images/controlledcutting/SaraAli_kerf4.jpg){width="80%"}

And finally I used this equation to calculate the kerf
![](../images/controlledcutting/SaraAli_kerf5.jpg){width="60%"}

Kerf= (60-57.86)/12= 0.17833mm

## **microsurface plastic (Ohood Walid)**

For the group assignment I selected red microsurface plastic 1.50mm & tested several cutting & engraving settings as shown below

**Cutting test**

| Power |  Speed  |  Frequency  | note                                                                           |
|-------|---------|-------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 100   | 2       | 2000Hz      | It didnâ€™t cut the cardboard                                                    |
| 60    | 1       | 2000Hz      | The cardboard was cut all the way but it was still hard to remove              |
| 60    | 0.8     | 2000Hz      | The best settings so far                                                       |


**Engrave test**

| Power |  Speed  |  Frequency  | note                 |
|-------|---------|-------------|----------------------|
| 50    | 30      | 1000PPI     | Not neat             |
| 60    | 50      | 1000PPI     | Clear engraving      |

**Kerf measurement**

Kerf is decided by material properties and thickness, the focal distance of the lens and therefore the gas used while cutting. you can use the following methods:

the average kerf for that material and material thickness is measure by Dividing the gap by 5. The result as following

1. to calculate the kerf draw a rectangle with length of 80mm by 40mm

2. divided it into 4 pieces

3. cut it with the laser cutter

4. measure the pieces together

5. then use the following equation: (Actual length - Measured length) / (Number of cuts+1)= Kerf.

Kerf = (80-78.45)/5= 0.31


![](../images/controlledcutting/w3-k1.JPG){width="60%"}

the second method a straightforward test to measure the kerf by measured the gap then dividing by 5

Kerf = 1.53/5= 0.30

## 6mm Acrylic Kerf Calculating (Mohammad Alsamsi) 


**Kerf** = **Width**

**Kerf** is defined as the width of material that is removed by a cutting process. It was originally used to describe how much wood was removed by a saw, because the teeth on a saw are bent to the side, so that they remove more material than the width of the saw blade itself, preventing the blade from getting stuck in the wood.[esabna.com](https://www.esabna.com/us/en/education/blog/what-is-cutting-kerf.cfm)

[esabna.com](https://www.esabna.com/us/en/education/blog/what-is-cutting-kerf.cfm)


In this assignment I'll measure the kerf for laser cutting machine.

I have started with Fusion 360 to design a rectangle and divide it by 20

For this assignment I used Trotec speedy 400 flexx laser machine.

![](../images/controlledcutting/Mohammad/Trotec.jpg)

Add 6mm Acrylic sheet to the machine and use the keypad to set the focus (AF)

![](../images/controlledcutting/Mohammad/Keypad.jpg)

Import the DXF file to the machine software and the set setting as following 

![](../images/controlledcutting/Mohammad/6mmAcrylicLaserSetting.png)

Start cutting the Acrylic sheet 

![](../images/controlledcutting/Mohammad/KerfCut.jpg)

Remove the cutting parts and measure the size

To find the Kerf width use the following equation
